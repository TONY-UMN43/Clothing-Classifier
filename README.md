A Deep Learning Project that explores **single-label**, using PyTorch. The goal was to use my own dataset of Pens and Pencils to train a Convolutional Neural Network Model that can make accurate predictions about any image that contains a pencil, pen, or both. 

# Project Highlights
- Created and Trained ResNet18 CNN Models using **PyTorch**
- Developed pipeline for **binary** classification
- Visualized results with **matplotlib** and **confusion matrices**
- Documented results in **Jupyter Notebook **
  
# Project Description
This project was developed to demonstrate a real-life application for Binary Classification. At its core, this project uses the CNN Architecture to extract features from images and then uses those features to make predictions on new images that the model hasn't seen before. The Pre-Trained ResNet18 model was used for this Binary Classification task because the ResNet18 is a powerful model that can be used on small datasets to detect key features from a collection of images. Because of this, the model can make predictions with high accuracy and the training stage is quicker than a Custom Pytorch NN Model.
