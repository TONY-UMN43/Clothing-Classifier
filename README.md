A Deep Learning Project that explores **single-label**, using PyTorch. The goal was to use my own dataset of Pens and Pencils to train a Convolutional Neural Network Model that can make accurate predictions about any image that contains a pencil, pen, or both. 

# Project Highlights
- Created and Trained ResNet18 CNN Models using **PyTorch**
- Developed pipeline for **binary** classification
- Visualized results with **matplotlib** and **confusion matrices**
- Documented results in **Jupyter Notebook **
  
# Project Description
This project scans an image and predicts whether the image contains a shoe or a sock. 

# Technology Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python, PyTorch, PyTorchVision, PyTorchUtils
- Pre-Trained ResNet18
- SkLearnMetrics
- MatPlotLib for Visualization
